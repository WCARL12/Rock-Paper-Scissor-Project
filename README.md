### Summary
For my JavaScript project, I want to create a simple rock paper scissors game. I feel it would
be beneficial to create that game because it involves a heavy amount of user interaction
which is solved by JavaScript. Interactions such as clicking user choice, creating an algorithm
to select the computer choice and changing of the screen are one of the things that is
involved in JavaScript.

### Project Timeline:
* Week 1: Regain the familiarity with JavaScript
* Week 2: Research various UI and create the starting screen, in-game screen, display
choices screen, and end-game
* Week 3: Implement the JavaScript interactivity on the website.

### Tools:
* HTML
* CSS
* JavaScript
* GitHub

### Flow of the game
1.) Have a UI for the starting screen <br>
2.) Make the user click a “Start” button <br>
3.) User select a choice (Rock Paper Scissor) <br>
4.) Display who wins based on Player and Computer choice <br>
5.) Keep repeating until either player or computer reached score of 3 <br>
6.) Display the winner
